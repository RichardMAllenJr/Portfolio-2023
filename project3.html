                <h3>Annotations</h3>
                <p>Working with this client, we first wanted to take stock of what they had already. We wanted to find what worked and what could be improved upon. The client stated that they mostly wanted to improve upon two main things, first they wanted the site to make sure that they are male and that they are trustworthy for their business. Secondly he wanted to show that his business is more geared towards medical based massage/healing services.</p>

                <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
                    <p>We also did user interviews, and asked people about their massage/relaxation habits, gaining insights into how people relax and how we might be able to market The Peaceful Palm to potential users/customers.</p>

                        <h3>Concept A</h3>
                        <p>Taking a mobile first design philosophy, we designed this first iteration by putting the most important content at the forefront, and by making sure to have calls to actions (CTA’s) within the site content, but also having a menu design.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col s12 m12 l12">
                        <img class="materialboxed" src="images/projectassets/project3/peacepamwire2.png" />
                        <h3>Concept B</h3>
                        <p>In the second iteration, we revised the menu design; at first we wanted something more unconventional with the menu design, but during user tests, users could not figure out what the menu was. So for this iteration, we designed a more conventional hamburger menu design.</p>

                    <h3 class="center-align">Feature 1</h3>
                    <p>After many testing and redesigning, we settled on having the logo of the site be the menu for the site, we wanted something that is unconventional while still being easy to use. Simply adding the word“menu”to the logo made it so that users understood that the logo is the menu.</p>

                <div class="col s12 m6 l6">

                    <h3 class="center-align">Feature 2</h3>
                    <p>Something that we noticed while going through the client’s site, is that they relied upon the nav bar for their navigation and when they did have cta buttons, it lead to other pages (i.e. the book now button lead to the services page instead of booking.) So for our design we made sure that the call to action buttons lead to what the button was, “book now”to booking page & “our services”to services page, etc.</p>

                    <p>For this project, I think that we learned just how much teamwork can help with each individual’s shortcomings. Like while working through this project we attempted to push our design abilities to their limits, and ran into some design road blocks that coul be solved with coding. For example our calendar served it’s purpose by being able to select a date wanted, but it couldn’t show what dates and times have already been booked. This is where the Front-End team would come in and implement our design ideas.</p>

                    <p>We found that marketing with a site alone is incredibly difficult, let alone with a site’s desing by itself. Marketing is a different team for a reason, and we tried our best to fulfill the client’s request within the scope of the website.</p>
