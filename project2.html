                    <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides incalculable labor data to both private and public users with a wide variety of needs. But, the website can also be difficult to navigate. So, my group partner, Emily, and myself worked to redesign their website with the intention of keeping the data provided, but make sure that the data provided would be easy for anyone to find.</p>

                <h3>Defined User Path</h3>
                <p>At first we tried to figure out why a user would come to the bls.gov website, and we found that a user would go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (bls.gov) in order to find relevant information on wage and labor statistics across the U.S., i.e. current Employment and Unemployment rates for a given region, or to find the projected growth for a given career.</p>

                <h3>Annotations</h3>
                <p>We then took stock of what the website had to offer and took screenshots then annotated aspects of the site that we found most helpful, and more often than not what makes the site hard to navigate.</p>

                <h3>Site Map</h3>
                    <p>We then took what the site had and mapped out an ideal way to navigate the site, specifically we mapped an ideal way to find the unemployment rate for a city (in this case Austin, TX)</p>

                        <p>With the first design iteration we wanted to make sure to put the most relevant information at the front of the page and easily digestible to what the user would search for.</p>

                    <h3 class="center-align">Feature 1</h3>
                    <p>We wanted to put labor statistics at the forefront, so in the initial design we thought to put a map showing the states current unemployment rate that would then can be clicked into the labor data for that state.</p>

                <div class="col s12 m6 l6">

                    <h3 class="center-align">Feature 2</h3>
                    <p>The bls.gov website is dense with data and content, but it can be overwhelming with just how dense it is. So the main feature that we strove to implement was making the site more easy to navigate and palatable helping users want to go through the site and get the data that they need.</p>

                    <p>But, the site’s appearance can be overwhelming, and take away from their content. It’s important to strike a balance between the appearance and the content.</p>
                    <p>The ability for the user to navigate a site is just as, if not more than, important as the site’s content. The bls.gov has a wealth of data and content, but what use is having it if a normal user cannot find it. During the process of this project we learned just how important usability is to the user and ultimately a project.</p>
