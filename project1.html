                        <h3>Hermes Travel Guide</h3>
                        <p>Travelers find that it can be difficult to stay safe while traveling. Planning a safe trip and trying to stay safe while traveling can be stressful and in certain circumstances even dangerous. So, I attempted to design an app that would make it easy for travelers to research areas and help the user prepare for what their travels may entail.</p>

                        <h3>Interviews</h3>
                        <p>This research study was prepared in order to inform the design and features of a new travel application. More specifically, I would like to explore how people currently plan out their travels before the trip and how they plan each of their days of travel, along with how safety impacts their beliefs on travel and exploring new areas outside of their own purview.</p>

                        <h3>Affinity Diagrams</h3>
                        <p>During the interviews and surveys I discovered that a majority of individuals find planning and researching the most challenging part about trip planning and most had underprepared at least once while traveling.</p>

                        <h3>Persona</h3>
                        <p>It is difficult for people to stay safe while they are traveling. Not only is planning a trip around certain safety guidelines challenging, but it is also hard for people to stay safe while in unforeseen situations. Travelers would greatly benefit from an app that would help them research areas and help the user prepare for what the given area may need.</p>

                    <h3 class="center-align">Insights</h3>
                    <p>In summary, I have learned that a strong idea is not enough to rely on; trying to translate what the user needs and how to implement solutions to those needs are far more important. I have also realized that I didn’t spend enough time with the writing in my descriptions of the city’s and the safety assessments. The core concept of the app is to give safety information while traveling, more time should be spent getting as much accurate safety information for the user as possible. Finally, having tour guides listed as a feature is good to have, but it should be clear to the user why the guides listed are on the app for a reason; and should only promote those who are willing to guide the user safely around the area.</p>

                    <h3 class="center-align">Next Steps</h3>
                    <li>Iterate IOS Prototype</li>
                    <li>Research more on the city’s that will be listed, and how safe they would be to travel to.</li>
                    <li>Would love to integrate with travel agency to combine resources on the users needs.</li>
                    <li>Would love to have an interactive map showing the safety information of the area; maybe showing “hot zones”.</li>
